\chapter{Introduction}
	
Nowadays, we are seeing how much reliance is put into Artificial Intelligence, especially when statistical techniques come in.\newline
The combination of AI and MASL (known as Machine Learning in computer science), gives us a set of very powerful tools in order to accomplish the hardest objectives. Most of the times, these techniques are used for financial business but what happens when we try to apply Machine Learning to Computer Security?\newline
In this paper we will see how powerful can be statistical models when applied to computer security, how they can be applied and in what field and what are the techniques to be used and the steps to build a resilient and secure system.\newline
The focus will be on Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (roughly, you can think to an Anti-Virus as an IPS) based on Anomaly Detection techniques.\newline
Anomaly Detection relies on defining a model for the \emph{normal} behaviour of a user into a system and comparing the observed behaviour of actual users (or programs) with the established model, in order to detect attacks and intrusion. for sake of understanding, you can think to a malware (e.g. a virus) as a "bad user" trying to gain control of your computer system.\newline\newline

In this paper we will go through these topics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A general overview of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
	\item An overview of the techniques used for \emph{Feature Selection}
	\item An overview of the techniques used for \emph{Classification}
	\item A practical implementation
\end{itemize}
